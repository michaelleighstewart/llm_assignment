## Financial Planning (from requirements)
What are some tax minimization strategies for a high-income couple in Australia?

### Expected Sample Records:

• Salary Sacrifice into Superannuation
Encourage your client to make salary sacrifice contributions to their superannuation
fund. These are taxed at 15%, which is lower than their marginal tax rate. The current
cap is $27,500 per person per year, including employer contributions.

• Spouse Superannuation Contributions
If one partner earns significantly less, the higher-income partner can contribute up to
$3,000 to their spouse's superannuation and receive a tax offset of up to $540.

• Negative Gearing on Investment Property
If they own an investment property or plan to purchase one, the interest on the loan and
associated expenses can be claimed as a deduction. If the property is negatively geared
(i.e., rental income is less than the expenses), it can reduce taxable income.
